# What is This?
This is a c++ clock with a stupid function coded by me XD

## What can this clock do?
It allow you to set a time when the time you seted is up it will auto move your cursor to the position you have seted

## How to use?
First, when you start the exe, it will show your cursor position on the console for 10 times (Please remember these 2 number)
  
Next, it will ask for the position you want to set
  
Then, it will ask for the hour and minutes you want to set
Done! When it finished the job, it will be closed automatically
  
/* Important! */  
It is based on 24- hour o'clock 
Hours e.g 13 == 1， 14 == 2 ， 15 == 3 ........
Minutes e.g can just enter 1 instead of 01  
/* Important! */

## why i coded this?
I'm lazy, when i afk during Teams class i don't wanna stay in front of my pc and wait till to the end ,so i coded this which allow me to set up a timer and it will automatically click on the exit position when time is up! (Just joking UwU) This idea just pop off in my head
